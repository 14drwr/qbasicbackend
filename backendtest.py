# This is a python file to test qbasicbackend.py


#to test this shit just call backend() with the parameters that you have for your test case
#so that each test case is one call on backend
#so if i was testing where transactionList was ["NEW 1234567 000 0000000 Name"] and 
#masterAccount = [""] then i would call backend(["NEW 1234567 000 0000000 Name"], [""])

from qbasicbackend import backend
#Creation Transactions Testing



#Withdraw Transactions Testing
